                    Management
                    The Congregation of Fransalians a body of Priests and brothers was founded at Annecy in France. The
                    motherhouse of Fransalians is still at Annecy. Fr. Peter Marie Mermier<br> (1790-1862) founded the
                    congregation of missionaries of St. Francis de Sales (MSFS) in 1838 to bring about the renewal of
                    Christian life, to evangelise people and to educate the youth. Since<br> then, the congregation has
                    been
                    engaged in three main forms of apostolate Parish mission, foreign mission and the education of the
                    young. The first batch of MSFS landed in Pondicherry on 8th September 1845.<br> The congregation
                    entrusted the vicariate of Visakhapatnam to MSFS on 2nd May 1848. It became a Province in 1965 and
                    Nagpur was bifurcated and made into another province in the same year, ie. <br>1965. The confreres
                    in
                    France and Switzerland were directly under the Superior General till 1959. It became a region in
                    1960 and a province in 1965 similarly England and Brazil also became <br>Province in 1965. East
                    Africa
                    became Province in 1996. Pune Province was carved out of erst while Maharashtra, Goa Province in
                    1996. Thus the congregation became empowered and has today 9 Major Provinces,<br> and 4 effective
                    missions
